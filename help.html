            <h5 class="question">What is an experimental feature:</h5>
            <p class="answer">Many new features have been added to the extension that can not be full tested before
                release. So these features are marked as experimental for a period while any usability issues or bugs
                can be identified. They have been tested to the same extend as other features prior to release but issue
                may persist due to the nature of these features. If you find any issues with these features please
                report it to the support form <a href="#" id="experimentalReport"> here</a></p>

                can hold down the ctrl button before selecting a list. If that does not work, you will need to disable
                the setting and then re-enabled it once you have edited/deleted the desired list</p>
